Easylist, parsed and mirrored by https://firebog.net
Updated 21AUG24 from https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt
This is sourced from an "adblock" style list which is flat-out NOT designed to work with DNS sinkholes
There WILL be mistakes with how this is parsed, due to how domain names are extracted and exceptions handled
Please bring any parsing issues up at https://github.com/WaLLy3K/wally3k.github.io/issues prior to raising a request upstream
If your issue IS STILL PRESENT when using uBlock/ABP/etc, you should request a correction at https://github.com/easylist/easylist#list-issues
